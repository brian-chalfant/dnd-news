## 🎲 Core Features

1. **WotC Release Roadmap**: Curated schedule of all key 2025/2026 rulebooks, campaign sourcebooks, accessories, and adventure modules.
2. **Dynamic Countdown Calculator**: Automatically calculates release status tags relative to the system date (e.g., *Releasing tomorrow!*, *Releasing in 3 months*, or *Released on [Date]*).
3. **Live EN World News Scraper**: Integrated RSS feed reader that downloads and parses community topics, filtering specifically for WotC, D&D Beyond updates, book pre-orders, and announcements.
4. **Dark Fantasy Glassmorphic UI**: High-fidelity theme featuring crimson and dragon-fire orange gradients, glowing category badges, hover transitions, and skeleton loaders.
5. **RPG Tweet Composer Drawer**:
   * **Thematic Style presets**: Draft messages using *Hype Bard* (pro), *Casual Player* (enthusiastic), or *Short Scroll* (minimal) layout structures.
   * **RPG Emojis**: Auto-injects class-themed emojis (`🎲`, `🐉`, `📜`, `⚔️`, `✨`) matching the product category.
   * **Twitter Character Count Safety**: Substitutes out links for a flat 23-character count (per Twitter's link policy) to prevent draft overflow.
   * **Web Intent Integration**: Immediate redirection to post drafts directly on X (Twitter).

## ⚙️ Configuration

* **Cache TTL**: News feed items are cached in memory for 5 minutes (`300` seconds) in `app.py` to prevent redundant network calls. You can adjust this duration by modifying `CACHE_TTL` in [app.py](file:///D:/AICourse/agy-cli-projects/app.py#L102).
* **Keywords Filter**: Adjust the lists `keywords` and `book_keywords` in [app.py](file:///D:/AICourse/agy-cli-projects/app.py#L145-L146) to customize what articles are flagged as book releases.
